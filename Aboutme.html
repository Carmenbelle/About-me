    A brief Introductory About Myself
</h1>
<p> 
    My name is Carmen Amba, I am from Akwa Ibom State based in Abuja. I am from a 
    polygamous family, narrowing down to my own family, we are six in number
    which am the 5<sup>th</sup> child to my mother. my father(blessed memory)
    was a business man and my mother is a civil servant.
</p><br>

<h2>My Career Path</h2>
<p>
    While i was growing up in school, a computer teacher offered to be my friend,
    she was always teaching me basic components of Computer. I left the school and 
    I lost contact with the teacher. learning about Computer became dormant at that point.
    quantitative and mathematics became my best subject and I thought of becoming a 
    mathematician which many people were against the idea with no substitute. I ended
    up studying Mass Communication in Cross River State University, Calabar. 
</p>

<p>
    While in the University, I had so much Computer related courses I offered
    ranging from Introduction to Computer Science, Desktop Publishing, Web 2.0,
    Online Journalism, Internet and its Application, Coding etc. They almost became
    my best my best courses which I had A's in most, I picked interest in knowing it 
    further and today am in <strong>Altschool</strong>
</p><br>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>
    The step in enrolling for Altschool is a big time growth for me because
    I believe I can see this to the end and beyond, once I take step to do something,
    i do it to the end no matter the challenges. I pray God should keep my grit
    alive and all others with similar passion. Giving up is not an option.
